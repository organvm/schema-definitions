# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add eighteen governance-memory v1 contracts for source custody projections,
  dynamic source census, stable normalized events, complete normalization
  parity, dual-lane lineage, governance testament, assertion evidence,
  receipt-derived ideals, node self-images, Iceberg Atlas rendering, bounded
  nine-stage cadence, frozen snapshot bundles, exact coverage, owner
  resolution, and typed parameters.
- Add provider-neutral examples and semantic validation for exact coverage,
  stable identity, promotion crosswalks, evidence independence, reviewed
  adoption, candidate/ratification gates, self-image completeness, stage
  bounds, receipt chaining, two-run fixed points, and secret-reference safety.
- Define `exact_all` as exactly-once classification of the frozen denominator;
  expose `ready` separately so classified inaccessible sources retain owner
  debt, and prohibit `closed_with_owner_routed_debt` from aliasing readiness.
- Require candidate testaments to omit ratification and ratified testaments to
  bind immutable operator events, assertion evidence, the candidate digest,
  controlling formulation, and unblocked constitutional coverage.
- Add regression fixtures proving renamed and newly introduced providers require
  configuration changes only.
